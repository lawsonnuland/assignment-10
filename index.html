    <p>So, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you're computer has been infected with a virus. On the upside, its nothing serious! The downside is, any image you click on from now on just becomes a picture of a dog. Which, depending, might be your cup of tea. See for yourself by clicking on the images below, but try to keep it under control.</p>
    <img id="image1" src="images/human1.jpg" alt="The first image">
    <p id="text1">Please don't turn Demetri Martin into a pair of dogs.</p>
    <img id="image2" src="images/human2.jpg" alt="The second image">
    <p id="text2">Eliel Cruz deserves better. Please restrain yourself.</p>
    <img id="image3" src="images/human3.jpg" alt="The third image">
    <p id="text3">UF President Kent Fuchs is fine as is. Please don't click him.</p>
    <img id="image4" src="images/human4.JPG" alt="The fourth image">
    <p id="text4">Its pointless to try and stop you from turning Lil Wayne into a dog, huh.</p>
